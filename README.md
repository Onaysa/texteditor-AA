# texteditor-AA

## Description

 I built a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.


## Credits


I used the starter code in bootcamp folder, and some code from stackoverflow.
